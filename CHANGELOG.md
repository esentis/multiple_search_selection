## 2.6.0 Breaking Changes & New Features

### New features

- Introduces a new constructor `MultipleSearchSelection.overlay` in which the showed items, act as an overlay instead of pushing bottom widgets. You can customise overlay's behaviour through `OverlayOptions`.

| Overlay                                               | Default                                               |

### Breaking changes

The implementation of `searchField` has been updated for enhanced customization. You can now use the `searchField` parameter to pass a fully customizable `TextField`. This change offers greater flexibility in tailoring the search field to your specific needs. Please note that the `onChanged` event is managed internally. For capturing changes in the search field, use `onSearchChanged` instead of `onChanged`.

Below already exposed parameters are removed :

- `searchFieldInputDecoration`
- `searchFieldTextStyle`
- `showClearSearchFieldButton`
- `searchFieldInputDecoration`
- `autoCorrect`
- `enableSuggestions`
- `searchFieldBoxDecoration`
- `searchFieldTextEditingController`
- `searchFieldFocus`

Parameters renamed to better reflect their purpose :

- At `CreateOptions` class:
  - `createItem` to `create`
  - `createItemBuilder` to `createBuilder`
  - `pickCreateItem` to `pickCreated`
  - `onItemCreated` to `onCreated`
  - `onDublicateItem` to `onDuplicate`
- `textFieldFocus` to `searchFieldFocus`

## 2.5.6 ‚ú® New features

- Introduces a new parameter, `MultipleSearchController`, which serves as a `controller` for accessing both displayed and selected items. The only limitation is that it must be utilized after the widget has been constructed.

```dart
controller.getAllItems();
controller.getPickedItems();
```

- Introduces additional options in `CreateOptions` for the `creatable` widget:
  - `allowDuplicates`: This option is set to `true` by default. When set to `false`, it prohibits the selection of any new `T` item that already exists. It's important to note that `T` must implement the `==` method for the library to accurately determine whether the `T` item already exists among displayed or picked items.
  - `onDuplicateItem(T)`: This callback function is triggered when an attempt is made to add a duplicate item.

## 2.5.5 ‚ú® New features

- Adds a new flag `placePickedItemContainerBelow` which defaults to `false`. Picked items will be displayed at the bottom instead of top

## 2.5.4 ‚ú®üî• New features & Breaking changes

- Renames `textFieldFocus` to `searchFieldFocus`
- Adds `autoCorrect` flag, to check if the search field should auto correct the input text
- Adds `enableSuggestions` flag, to check if the search field should provide suggestions

## 2.5.3 ‚ú® Adds screenshots & Allows higher than 3.0.0 version SDK

## 2.5.2 üêõ Bug fixes

- Resolves the inconsistency where ShowedItemsVisibility.onType was showing all items after selecting one from the list.

## 2.5.1 üêõ Bug fixes

- Fixes range exception issue when selecting all items

## 2.5.0 ‚ú®üî• New features & Breaking changes

### Breaking changes

- Removes deprecated parameters

### Features

- Adds `maxSelectedItems` parameter to specify the maximum amount of items the user can select from the items' list. If the maximum number is picked:
  - The search TextField is disabled and the items' list is hidden.
  - The select all button is hidden.
  - The show items button is hidden, if the item visibility is Toggle.
  - The dialog of the items is popped, if the item visibility is Toggle.

## 2.4.5 üêõ‚ú® Bug fixes & New features

### Fixes

- Resolves an issue with `showedItems` not dissapearing when `itemsVisibility == ShowedItemsVisibility.onType` & `clearSearchFieldOnSelect == true`

### Features

- Adds `showedItemsExtent` flag.
  When we have very large lists with dynamic content, unfortunately there is an open [issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/52207) in Flutter that causes the list to be very slow when scrolled with the srollbar. In that case you can set this to use a fixed height for each item resolving the jankiness. The downside obviously would be that you can't have dynamic height items.

## 2.4.4 üêõ Bug fixes

- Resolves an issue when the clear textfield button was not resetting showed items.

## 2.4.3 ‚ú® New features

- Renames `outerContainer` to `searchField` to properly reflect its purpose.

- Adds a new parameter called `searchFieldBoxDecoration`, which allows you to specify the decoration of the top portion of the dialog box when the `ShowedItemsVisibility` is set to `toggle`.

- Adds deprecated flags to exposed `Decoration` parameters from `pickedItemsBoxDecoration`, `searchFieldBoxDecoration` & `showedItemsBoxDecoration`. Will be removed on next version.

- Fixes discrepancies of the decoration parameters.

## 2.4.2 üêõ Bug fixes

- Fixes short circuiting issue

## 2.4.1 üêõ Bug fixes

- Resolved issue of displayed items failing to wrap when there were fewer items to display in the container.

## 2.4.0 ‚ú®üî• New features & Breaking changes

- Refactored the displayed items to use lazy loading, resulting in a significant improvement in performance for large lists. Additionally, the index is now accessible for further customization.

```dart
itemBuilder: (country, index) {
    if (index==0) return Text('Hello World');
    return Padding(
    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(6.0),
    child: Container(
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(6),
        color: Colors.white,
         ),
        child: Padding(
         padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(
            vertical: 20.0,
            horizontal: 12,
         ),
         child: Text(country.name),
      ),
    ),
  );
},
```

- Exposes some more `InputDecoration` parameters :
  - Adds `showClearSearchFieldButton` which adds a suffix icon to clear searchfield
  - Adds `hintText`
  - Adds `textFieldFocus`
  - Adds `textEdittingController`
- If `pickedItemsContainerBuilder` is provided it will build even if no items are picked

## 2.3.7 ‚ú® New features

- Adds `pickedItemsContainerBuilder`. You can now provide your own custom `Widget` for the picked items. `pickedItems` (`List<Widget>`) are created from the `pickedItemBuilder`. So having those items you can customise the layout at your needs.

```dart
pickedItemsContainerBuilder: (pickedItems) => Center(
    child: Container(
    height: 150,
    width: 150,
    decoration: BoxDecoration(
        border: Border.all(color: Colors.grey[400]!),
      ),
    child: ListView(
        children: pickedItems,
    ),
  ),
),
pickedItemBuilder: (country) {
    return Padding(
    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8),
    child: Center(
        child: Text(
        country.name,
        style: const TextStyle(
            color: Colors.blue,
            decoration: TextDecoration.underline,
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
},
```

## 2.3.2 ‚ú® New features

New constructor added `MultipleSearchSelection<T>.creatable` which can now create new item when search result does not return any results. It takes a new required parameter, `createOptions` e.g :

```dart
// [T] here is [Country]
createOptions: CreateOptions<Country>(
    // You need to create and return the item you want to add since [T] is not always [String].
    createItem: (text) {
        return Country(name: text, iso: text);
    },
    // Create item Widget that appears instead of no results.
    createItemBuilder: (text) => Align(
        alignment: Alignment.centerLeft,
            child: Padding(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
                child: Text('Create "$text"'),
            ),
        ),
    // Whether you want to pick the newly created item or just add it to your list. Defaults to false.
